## MATCHING MEMORY GAME

* INTRODUCTION
A react project game to finish off the implementation of a one-player matching game.

This project explores where react-redux fits into an application by finishing off the implementation of a one-player matching game.

The application consists of 5 React components:

App: The root component, App renders the Score and Board components.
Score: Child of the App component, Score will display the number of matched cards.
Board: Child of the App component, Board will create the card grid for gameplay.
CardRow: Child of the Board component, CardRow renders a row of Card components.
Card: Child of the CardRow component, Card displays the card content when flipped over.
One goal of this project will be to show that a nested component like Card can access data and dispatch actions as easily as a higher-level component like App or Score.
